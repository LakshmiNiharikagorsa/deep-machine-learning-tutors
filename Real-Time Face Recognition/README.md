# Do you know how to implement for Real-Time Face Recognition with an simple code?

Here Eazy Ciphers came with an eazy code for begineers in OpenCV which helps to recognize real-time face.

This model of training gives an accuracy of 99%. For training of input, we have to keep some sort of images in a folder where the user needs to train the model with the code.

Before entering into the description of running and training our model. One user must have to make sure that in their Environment OpenCV installed or not. 
If not installed install using below command:
```python
pip install opencv-python
```
### Installing Face Recognition module in windows: 

For face recognition module installation follow the below pip command to get through the recognition platform with an ease.

```python
pip install face_recognition
```

You can also try to installing in any python platform which supports face_recognition module.
